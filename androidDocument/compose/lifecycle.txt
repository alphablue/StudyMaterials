고민) 라이프 사이클이 뷰와 결합되어 있을때 compose 는 어떻게 메모리에서 삭제할 수 있을까?
또는 어떤 생명주기를 가질까?

ompose disposes of the Composition whenever the ComposeView becomes detached from a window. This is undesirable when ComposeView is used in fragments for multiple reasons:

The Composition must follow the fragment's view lifecycle for Compose UI View types to save state, and
to keep the Compose UI elements on the screen when transitions, or window transitions happen. During transitions, the ComposeView itself is still visible even after it is detached from the window.
You can manually call the AbstractComposeView.disposeComposition method to dispose of the Composition manually. Alternatively, for disposing Compositions automatically when they're no longer needed, set a different strategy or create your own by calling the setViewCompositionStrategy method.

Use the DisposeOnViewTreeLifecycleDestroyed strategy to dispose of the Composition when the LifecycleOwner of the fragment is destroyed.

As PlantDetailFragment has enter and exit transitions (check nav_garden.xml for more info), and we'll use View types inside Compose later, we need to make sure the ComposeView uses the DisposeOnViewTreeLifecycleDestroyed strategy. Nonetheless, it's a good practice to always set this strategy when using ComposeView in fragments.
